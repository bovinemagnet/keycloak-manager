# keycloak-manager

Command-Line tool to manage keycloak deployments.

I needed a command line tool to manage various keycloak functions from an automation perspective.  Rather than have a bunch of individual tools such as `keycloak-bulk-user-import` then one for delete, one for realms, etc.  I though I would combine it all into a single application.

Written in Go, this is also my journey into go and keycloak.
